Abstract: "*The production of different exhaustible resources, and mining in particular, are a source of stock pollutants and the growth of these stocks can be constrained by abatement and taxation. However, the firm may have incentives to non-comply with these regulations. This study analyzes the enforcement of an emission tax in a dynamic model, which includes stock externalities and abatement by the mining firm and by natural processes. The purpose of this investigation is two-fold. First, to study the consequences of a given enforcement scheme in a dynamic model and to generalize the results from previous static models. Second, to analyze the time paths of control variables and the violation level. It is argued that non-compliance in itself does not necessarily imply that net emissions from the mine are excessive compared to the full-compliance emission level. It is the possibility of a zero emission report that may cause the divergence from the socially optimal emission levels. The time path of violation and hence the path of unpaid taxes can have multiple shapes depending on the type of tax applied.*"

Abstract: "*Environmental issues during and after extraction are a major problem in contemporary exhaustible resource production. Production operation deteriorates the state of the environment and is a source of possibly harmful emissions. After the extraction has ceased, the site is in need of reclamation and clean-up. This paper analyses the last two stages of exhaustible resource production: extraction and site reclamation decisions. The socially optimal regulation is investigated, and it is found that a pollution tax, a shut-down date and a requirement for the firm to deposit funds for costly reclamation can be used to incentivize socially optimal extraction of the resource. It is also found that the firm can be required to pay the monies to a reclamation trust at the beginning of the extraction operation, which protects the tax payers from the possible insolvency of the firm who tries to avoid paying for the reclamation.*"

**Working papers:**

* "On optimal extraction under asymmetric information over reclamation costs", revise and resubmit, Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control

Abstract: "*Polluting exhaustible resource extraction ends with costly reclamation and producers have better information about future reclamation costs than the regulator. This paper analyzes optimal contract between the regulator and the mining firm in a two-stage model, in which extraction and pollution generation is followed by reclamation with asymmetric information over reclamation costs. The contract consists of a pollution tax and a mechanism used for cost information revelation, and it extracts all the profit from the highest-cost type, leaves profits for the more efficient types and dictates a reclamation effort that is lower than the complete information effort. It is further shown that the optimal  pollution tax under asymmetric information can be lower or higher than the tax under complete information. In addition, the exclusion of the most expensive types is analyzed. The results can help to design policies that improve the existing ones by saving public funds, by improving the state of the environment and by excluding those mining operations that do not produce (net) benefits for the society.*"

* "From cradle to grave? On optimal nuclear waste disposal" with Jussi Lintunen, submitted (older title: On optimal nuclear waste disposal)

Abstract: "*This paper analyses socially optimal nuclear plant operation and nuclear waste management. Two waiting rules are derived: the first characterizes the optimal continuation of electricity production, and the second gives the optimal nuclear waste disposal date. Both rules balance the cost and benefit of either continuing production or delaying waste disposal into a deep geological repository. In addition, multiple regulatory options are investigated. The optimized waste storage and disposal cost forms the payment that should be collected from the nuclear power firm into a nuclear waste fund. The properties of this payment and other regulatory options including a tax to be paid at the shutdown date of the plant are investigated, and it is shown that the money can be collected by a plant-specific constant fee targeted at firm's profit or output. Numerical illustration shows that waste disposal to a deep geological repository is a cost-minimising solution only with very low interest rates. For interest rates above one percent it is optimal to store the waste in an on ground storage facility in perpetuity.*"

**Work in progress:**

* "On the choice between price and quantity instrument under endogenous lobby formation" (older title: Lobbying and environmental policy instruments)

Abstract: "*The choice between emission tax and emission quotas and the choice on the level of the instrument is analyzed in a political economy framework with endogenous lobby formation. The polluting firms can influence the choice between these instruments in addition to the level of the instrument, and choose whether to take part in the lobby group. %The equilibrium of the multi-stage game is characterized. 
It is shown that if some of the firms do participate in the lobby group, then the level of either instrument is different from the level that results in the social optimum. Sufficient conditions for the existence of non-null lobby group are presented in addition to a condition that results in a group that consists of firms with the lowest participation costs.  Furthermore, it is shown with specific function forms that the firms who expect to be lobbyists will unambiguously favor a quantity instrument over a price instrument, and can induce the regulator to choose this instrument.*"
