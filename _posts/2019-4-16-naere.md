The third Nordic Annual Environmental and Resource Economics workshop was held in University of Copenhagen on 11-12 of April. It gathered over 50
environmental and resource economists affiliated (or not) to Nordic universities and 
research organizations to share and discuss their ideas. Just like the previous workshops 
in Helsinki and Bergen, this workshop was a success in every way - and what's there not to like: good company, useful feedback and nice lunches, coffees and dinner.
Topics varied wildly from empirical papers to more theoretical ideas including applications to electricity markets,
fisheries, exhaustible resources and valuation. Next year's workshop will be organized by SLU in Uppsala 
(or that's what was told!).

This was the third workshop or conference where I presented the paper titled "On the optimal extraction under asymmetric information over reclamation costs". The previous ones were
 BIOECON in Cambridge and IAERE in Udine. Next stops are WCNRM and IAEE in Montreal.
