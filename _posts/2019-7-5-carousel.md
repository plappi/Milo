My conference-carousel ended yesterday in Turku (Finland), where the 15th European Meeting on Game Theory [(SING)](https://sing15.fi/) was held. Many of the presented
papers were quite technical and therefore hard for me to follow, but the trip was nevertheless worth the effort. The MILO-paper I presented there was
"On Optimal Extraction Under Asymmetric Information over Reclamation Costs", and I was lucky to receive nice, friendly 
feedback on the model. Before SING, I presented the paper "On Optimal Nuclear Waste Disposal" in [EAERE](http://www.eaere-conferences.org/) (the 24th annual conference of the European Association of Environmenta
and Resource Economists), which was held in Manchester. The research is joint work with Jussi Lintunen from Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke), and
we look at the nuclear waste disposal problem from an economic point of view.

The first spins of the carousel were
in Montreal, where I presented the same paper as in SING. The World Conference on Natural Resource Modeling [(WCNRM)](http://resourcemodeling.org/montreal-2019/) 
and the 42nd International
Association for Energy Economics [(IAEE)](https://iaee2019.org/) Annual Conference were both held in HEC Montreal. The conferences were quite different
 probably due to their size difference. This quote from the Resource Modeling Association's [website](http://resourcemodeling.org/conferences/) captures the essence of the WCNRM: 

>"*Small, diverse, multi-discipline conferences held in a convivial atmosphere where delegates treat one another as equals*". 

I recommend
their conference for those interested in natural resources and mathematical modeling, and for those who agree that policy advices for the improved
management our resources are best drawn together with other disciplines.

Oh, and to avoid any misunderstandings, that's Montreal, not Turku, in the cover image... (but I like both!)
